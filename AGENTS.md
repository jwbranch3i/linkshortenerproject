# Agent Instructions

This file is the entry point for all LLM coding instructions in this repo.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**ALWAYS read the relevant individual instructions files within the `/docs` directory BEFORE generating ANY code.** This is non-negotiable and takes absolute priority. Do not proceed with code generation without consulting the applicable documentation.

Read this file first, then follow the linked, topic-specific guidelines.
For detailed guidelines on specific topics, refer to the modular documentation in the `/docs` directory:


## Scope

- These instructions apply to all code changes in this repo.
- Topic-specific rules live under `/docs` and take precedence when relevant.
- When rules conflict, prefer the most specific file and the existing code style.

## Instruction Index
- [Auth (Clerk)](docs/auth.md)
- [UI Components (shadcn/ui)](docs/ui.md)
